## Synopsis

This program performs Newton-Raphson, using automatic differentiation to find the Yield to Maturity of a bond.

Yet to be implemented is interactivity and visual output (d3.js)

## Motivation

* To learn about Automatic Differentiation
* To learn some d3.js for interactive visualisation
* So use Automatic Differentiation instead of the secant method for Newton-Raphson 
* To implement Newton-Raphson to calculate Yield to Maturity
